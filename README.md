<h2>Mascotas Perdidas is a free to use project with the sole objective of bringing lost pets and owners together.:dog: </h2>

<h3>How to use the site?</h3>
It's very simple, you have to create an account :closed_lock_with_key:(this is to easier spot junk-uploading users) and then, it depends of what you want to do!
find your dog or tell everybody you found one. You need an email for contact, but you can add phone number or whatever as means of communication. I didn't add phone number as default to protect user privacy

:paw_prints: <strong>1)Find your lost dog</strong>
Go to the lost dogs section www.mascotasperdidas.club/all, and search for your dog giving their characteristics.
Colors-> The search is inclusive, so you need only one color to find your dog :dog2: If the amount of dogs grows large, I can add an exact search mode to be more specific in the query.
Sex->Male or Female. Some dogs may have been uploaded as unknown sex, so even if you selected a sex, you may encounter "?" sex dogs
Size->Yes, this is very subjective. You may need to try two sizes to spot your dog, given that the submitter may had chosen a size larger or smaller than your opinion or your dog. :stuck_out_tongue:
Any opinion in how to improve this? Let me know 	:smile:

:paw_prints: <strong>2)Report dog   </strong>
Navigate to www.mascotasperdidas.club/reportar and fill in the form. You will be asked to input basic information. First, you should choose whether you saw a dog on the street, you lost it or you carried it to your house (need more people like that!:clap:)
Don't forget to upload a good picture of the dog, so people can recognize them well. By now, only one picture is allowed by post.
Select in the map the position of the dog. If you picked it up, you may prefer to select the place where it was found and not your actual house.


You can eliminate your reports in www.mascotasperdidas.club/reported, specially if the dog was found/returned to it's owner. Let's avoid unuseful old posts! Post older than 3 months will be deleted automatically.

The information that is provided for finding the pet is obviously. <strong>public</strong> <br>
The user that made the post can remain anonymous just changing the default email presented in the form.
The contact email is the only personal information needed for making the post, but if for some reason you hate it, you can lie with the email (but please, give a contact information if you can help in any way!!)

<h3> üì§ üìó Roadmap</h3>
In the future I plan to gamify the game to make it more engaging. Using level and feats to make everything more appealing. Social approval can be healpful in determining whether a certain feat has been achieved or not. But this is will be discussed in more detail when the future arrives.

<strong>
‚òëÔ∏è Add cats to search<br>
 ‚òëÔ∏è Eliminate size for cats in search and upload forms.
üî≤ Gamification <br>
üî≤ In site chats (promoves engagement) <br>
üî≤ Record of found pets<br>
üî≤ All pets in a list, in order for "players" to be able to "find them". Like if there were Pokemons! </strong><br>
