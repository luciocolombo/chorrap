Mascotas Perdidas is a free to use project with the sole objective of bringing lost pets and owners together.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74058084/123521860-af05ea80-d68f-11eb-849b-8e0268b598c2.png)

How to use the site?
It's very simple, you have to create an account ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74058084/123521901-eb394b00-d68f-11eb-9974-61b5a7bf37b0.png) (this is to easier spot junk-uploading users) and then, it depends of what you want to do!

1)Find your lost dog
Go to the lost dogs section https://mascotasperdidas.netlify.app/all, and search for your dog giving their characteristics.
Colors-> The search is inclusive, so you need only one color to find your dog ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74058084/123521964-6dc20a80-d690-11eb-80ec-8e3c51d8bb88.png). If the amount of dogs grows large, I can add an exact search mode to be more specific in the query.
Sex->Male or Female. Some dogs may have been uploaded as unknown sex, so even if you selected a sex, you may encounter "?" sex dogs
Size->Yes, this is very subjective. You may need to try two sizes to spot your dog, given that the submitter may had chosen a size larger or smaller than your opinion or your dog. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74058084/123522017-d0b3a180-d690-11eb-9d44-29c2e1c44537.png)
