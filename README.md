<h2>Mascotas Perdidas is a free to use project with the sole objective of bringing lost pets and owners together.:dog: </h2>

<h3>How to use the site?</h3>
It's very simple, you have to create an account :closed_lock_with_key:(this is to easier spot junk-uploading users) and then, it depends of what you want to do!
find your dog or tell everybody you found one. The idea for the moment is for people to comunicate by email. I may add extra ways in the future if requested.

:paw_prints: <strong>1)Find your lost dog</strong>
Go to the lost dogs section www.mascotasperdidas.club/all, and search for your dog giving their characteristics.
Colors-> The search is inclusive, so you need only one color to find your dog :dog2: If the amount of dogs grows large, I can add an exact search mode to be more specific in the query.
Sex->Male or Female. Some dogs may have been uploaded as unknown sex, so even if you selected a sex, you may encounter "?" sex dogs
Size->Yes, this is very subjective. You may need to try two sizes to spot your dog, given that the submitter may had chosen a size larger or smaller than your opinion or your dog. :stuck_out_tongue:
Any opinion in how to improve this? Let me know 	:smile:

:paw_prints: <strong>2)Report dog   </strong>
Navigate to www.mascotasperdidas.club/reportar and fill in the form. You will be asked to input basic information. First, you should choose whether you saw a dog on the street, you lost it or you carried it to your house (need more people like that!:clap:)
Don't forget to upload a good picture of the dog, so people can recognize them well. By now, only one picture is allowed by post.
Select in the map the position of the dog. If you picked it up, you may prefer to select the place where it was found and not your actual house.


You can eliminate your reports in www.mascotasperdidas.club/reported, specially if the dog was found/returned to it's owner. Let's avoid unuseful old posts! Post older than 3 months will be deleted automatically.
